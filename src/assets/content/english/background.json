  "content": "Zalman Ackerman was born as an only child to a family in Warsaw of 1927.\r\nHis father was a hatter and his mother worked as a nurse in a Jewish hospital in their city. He is the only remnant from his family which he barely knew.\r\nIn September 1939, when the World War II started, he was only 12 years old. The problems of Warsaw's citizens, Zalman's family among them, began with the german's invasion.\r\nSome of the things Zalman remembers the most are the signs on the train cars which the Germans came with that said: \"We came here to make order with the Jews\". Zalman was in Warsaw Ghetto since it was established in 1940. The wall around the ghetto was 18 km long and 3 m high. Most of the times it was covered with wire or shards of glass. There were 22 gates at the wall, on each one 3 policemen were placed- a german one, a polish one and a Jewish one.\r\nZalman stayed in the ghetto from 1940 to 1943, when it was burnt down. The rest of the time of the war [until 1945] he was in the labor, concentration or extermination camps. The first camp Zalman was in is Majdanek, which was clearly an extermination camp. After that, he was in Skarzysko-Kamienna which was a labor camp for manufacturing heavy weapon for the german army.\r\nAfter Skarzysko-Kamienna he was transferred to another labor camp in Czechoslovakia, this time for manufacturing light weapon.\r\nIn January 1945 the Germans decided to transfer all the Jews to camps in Germany and Zalman was sent to Buchenwald- a concentration and extermination camp. From there he was transferred to \u05DE\u05E9\u05D4\u05D5 \u05E9\u05D3\u05D5\u05DE\u05D4 \u05DC\u05D0\u05D5\u05E4\u05D5\u05DC\u05E9\u05D8\u05D8 where he worked in repairing the german army's cars. At the end of the war Zalman took part in the death march, a few days before he was released by the American army.\r\n",
