In order to make these bombs, the workers had to lift an ingot [\u05DE\u05D8\u05D9\u05DC] of metal and put it in an open oven. Then they had to wait until it would be soft enough so they can change its shape to the wanted one. Zalman describes that job as a living hell, but it was still considered easier than the job he had in Majdanek.\r\nZalman was in Skarzysko-Kamienna until 1944, when it was destroyed. He was put in \u05E1\u05D5\u05DC\u05D9\u05D1 with another few hundreds of Jews. His job was to dig anti-tankish [??] channels. At the fall, he was added to a labor camp named Czestochowika [??] in Czestochowa, which reminded him a bit of Skarzysko-Kamienna. His work was packing bullets and it wasn't considered a hard work but it demanded maximal concentration. It was done while standing for a long time and the workers had one small break. These who couldn't take it and collapsed were immediately shot and new workers were brought to replace them.",
