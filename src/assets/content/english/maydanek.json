  "content": ".In Majdanek there was a shack called berk. In each berk were 300 prisoners. Every morning there was a \u05DE\u05E1\u05D3\u05E8 \u05D1\u05D5\u05E7\u05E8 which was called \u05D0\u05E4\u05DC\u05D9. In this \u05DE\u05E1\u05D3\u05E8 took part a few berks and it was done so the Germans would know nobody escaped.
